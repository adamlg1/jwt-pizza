# Curiosity Report
I made the mistake of accidentally having the back arrow hit by the mouse action in my first attempt of this assignment. I lost my entire writeup. This unfortunately increased my toil. I am going to work to avoid that by incrementally saving in this version.
## Toil
- Remember that you can only take on so much toil.
- We want to reduce toil so that we can spend more time innovating and doing cool engineering tasks.
- As a worker, you want to avoid being the one that loves taking on toil. If you take on too much, it could lead to your team continually taking on more toil, and members leaving for work that they can perform more engineering tasks in.
- You can only take on so much toil before you are going to burnout. Recognize that.
- The maximum is 50% of your time being spent on toil related tasks.
- In the words of Google, lets invent more and toil less.
- Remember the opportunity costs.
